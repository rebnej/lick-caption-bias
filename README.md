## Introduction
This repository contains source code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the paper [Quantifying Societal Bias Amplification in Image Captioning] (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Hirota_Quantifying_Societal_Bias_Amplification_in_Image_Captioning_CVPR_2022_paper.html). We propose a metric **LIC** to evaluate how much a captionig model amplifies societal bias (e.g., gender, race).
